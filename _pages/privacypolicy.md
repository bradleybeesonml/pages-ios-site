# Privacy Policy

BetterPlates is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information Storage

BetterPlates is designed with privacy in mind:
- All your recipes are stored locally on your device
- We do not collect or store any personal user data
- We do not maintain any user accounts or profiles
- We do not track your usage or behavior

## Recipe Processing

When you modify a recipe using our AI features:
- The recipe text is temporarily sent to our AI service provider for processing
- The recipe text is automatically deleted from their servers after processing is complete
- No personal information is sent along with the recipe text
- The AI processing is completely anonymous

## Third-Party Services

Our app uses a third-party AI service to process recipe modifications. This service:
- Only receives the recipe text needed for modification
- Does not receive any user identification information
- Deletes all recipe data after processing is complete
- Has its own privacy and security measures in place

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Your recipes are as secure as your device
- No one else can access your recipes without access to your device
- Deleting the app will remove all your recipe data
- We recommend keeping your device secured with a passcode

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.
